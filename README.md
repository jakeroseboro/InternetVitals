# Internet Vitals
Internet Vitals is a console application built using C# to monitor networking speed and information about the local network.

NOTE: This project requires .NET 6 to properly run.

In the future, a binary may be released, but for now, you can build from source by opening in a multitude of IDEs or whatever your preferred method for creating executables. You can then run the binary (example below), and experience the program first-hand:

### macOS/Linux
```bash
./pathToBinary/bin/InternetVitals get-vitals
```

### Windows
```powershell
./pathToBinary/bin/InternetVitals get-vitals
```

*Not all major platforms have been tested
